# Bitcoin Price Prediction Using LSTM Networks and Reddit Sentiment Analysis
This code was used to create an LSTM deep learning model to predict the closing prices of Bitcoin. 

The LSTM model is given the open, close, high, and low prices along with the market cap of a specified amount of previous days as inputs to output a predicted closing price of the given day. To go further, we incorporated the average daily sentiment of Reddit posts discussing Bitcoin to the model.

bitcoin_price_prediction.ipynb - Contains all code needed to run our model, including packages, data prep, visualization, and models

We used the following datasets from Kaggle:
